				<h1>Aperture Demonstrations</h1>
				The following apps were developed as part of a series of exercises in 
				agile development of visual analytics for big data. The exercises, each two to four weeks, 
				were designed to test rapid development of tailored solutions for complex analytic problems
				using Aperture, and to use the results to inform further development of the library.

					<h2>Money Flow: CharityNet</h2>
					CharityNet looks at the problem of large node-link data sets (graphs). In big data
					typical of many real world problems, a brute force approach of showing every 
					node in the data set does not scale (<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/papers/Shneiderman2006Network.pdf" target="_blank">Schneiderman, 2006</a>, et al). 
					Issues include inability to support user questions and task functions,
					limited visual expression of node and link semantics,
					and undue effort required to explore and understand.
					<p>
					Our research objectives in this phase were to investigate and develop aggregated 
					graph visualization techniques that:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Effectively summarize communities of nodes and their relationships.
					<li>Do not sacrifice key member node characteristics in the aggregation.
					<li>Are immediately readable, not <i>requiring</i> interaction for basic sense-making.
					</ul>
					Pillars of the technical approach include the following:
					<ul>
					<li>Graph Clustering, using Flow, Community, and Multi-Attribute techniques.
					<li>Aggregation Markers, using "Community Rings" to summarize member nodes.
					<li>Adaptive Labeling, by applying an optimized "Trellis Strategy" (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.163.2733&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">Mote, 2007</a>).
					</ul>
					
					<h3>The Analytic Question</h3>
					CharityNet consists of a data set of 5,730 charities, 1.8M donors, and 3.3M donations over 2 years. 
					The decision-oriented, analytic question posed for design of this exercise's solution was:
					<a href="http://aperture.oculusinfo.com/charitynet/" target="_blank"><i>Reveal a charity's donor characteristics, 
					and find strategies for increasing support.</i></a>

					<h2>Cyber Network Monitoring: VAST Challenge 2012</h2>

This app uses the <a href="http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2012" target="_blank">2012 Vast Challenge</a> problem and data set to 
look at issues of critical situation awareness across a network of a million computers. The VAST data set is a fabricated series of
workstation, server and ATM status and activity reports at fifteen minute intervals over a period of several days, for a fictional bank 
network.

<p>While the scenario revealed by the data is clearly contrived as a puzzle with singular answers, our goal was to 
design the app as if it were to be an effective monitoring tool for <i>any</i> scenario. A key assumption 
was that more than one indicator must be monitored simultaneously in order to portray a full picture of network status and health. This 
very likely presented a more ambitious challenge than intended by the VAST problem scenario.
</p><p>Our solution simultaneously displays summary 
counts of three classes of events  over time, of five levels of severity, across fifty bank regions and headquarters. Marking hours when
bank branches are closed and ordering by time zone reveals both concurrent and time-shifted patterns in network activity. Capabilities are
included for drill-down and comparison.
</p>
<h3>The Analytic Question</h3>
The challenge questions posed were to <a href="http://aperture.oculusinfo.com/vast/" target="_blank"><i>visualize "health and policy status" 
of the entire network at 2pm, February 2, and to subsequently identify five notable anomalies that occur in time</i></a>.

					<h2>Behavioral Trends and Projections, with Transparency</h2>
		
					This monitoring application displays the past and projected behavior of key indicators, starting with a geospatial summary across 
					all tracked countries. Clicking on a country of interest shows its indicators in detailed time series form. 
					Further drill-down into any one indicator reveals influence of contributing factors.
					
					<p>Transparency of the underlying model is 
					provided by a visualization technique of <i>linked visible behaviors</i>, coupled with narrative explanation. Provenance of source data 
					(not available in the model shown) is provided by <i>reference annotations</i>. 
					
					<p>This app was developed over a period
					of several months with a very early version of Aperture. The hybrid computational model and source data consisted of up to twelve years
					of weekly and annual values for hundreds of variables, feeding key indicators for each of five countries.
					Reference annotations provided a visualization of volume and provenance of data, with links to 
					source data that included key-word markup of articles mined for sentiment analysis.
					<p>The model and data set shown here is 
					a more limited example, built on a model of the steel industry. Not all features are supported by this model.</p>

					<h3>The Analytic Question</h3>
					Design focused on answers to the following key questions:
					<a href="http://aperture.oculusinfo.com/econmodel/" target="_blank"><i>what are current and projected global 
					trends for key countries, what are the root causal factors, and what is the nature of their influence?</i></a>
