	<p>This example shows how to load a static KML file and assign 
	visual mappings that draw from data stored in the KML file. We also
	show how additional data outside the KML file can be linked in as well,
	in this case to color the countries.</p>
	
	<div id="map" style="left: 0px; right: 0px; height:400px;"></div>
